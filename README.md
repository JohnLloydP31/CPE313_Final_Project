# Fatigue Detection using Hybrid Deep Learning Models
Using the capability of deep learning-based object detectors for robust fatigue detection, this solution uses real-time facial monitoring to detect indicators of drowsiness. Object detection plays an important role when determining fatigue indicators [12]. Three models will be used and compared to one another:
